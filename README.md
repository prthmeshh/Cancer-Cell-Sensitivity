# Cancer Treatment Prediction Model

## Overview

Cancer treatment often involves a challenging "trial-and-error" approach, relying on broad principles and empirical data. To address this, our project aims to develop a machine learning-based prediction model for accurately forecasting cancer cell sensitivity to specific drugs.

## Objectives

1. *Machine Learning Approach:* Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze complex relationships between genomic and chemical factors and corresponding drug responses.

2. *Feature Identification:* Conduct a comprehensive analysis to identify significant features and patterns that can serve as predictive indicators of drug sensitivity in cancer cells.

3. *Integration of Data:* Integrate genomic and chemical data to create a holistic model that facilitates more informed treatment decisions by oncologists.

## Expected Impact

The implementation of our prediction model is anticipated to enhance the cancer treatment selection process. By providing oncologists with accurate predictive indicators, our model aims to increase the likelihood of positive outcomes while minimizing side effects.
